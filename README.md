#aRtiNG

I originally created this as a fun evening project in a different repository, and slowly added features and functionality as I had ideas.  The project uses a `<canvas>` and some different painting algorithms to create pseudo-random colors and shapes.  You can control various parameters of the painting algorithms via the control panel at the bottom.  I originally wrote this in plain Typescript, but I've converted the outer couple of layers into React components just to make them easier to use in my other React-based tools.  

There isn't really a purpose to this project, but I would eventually like to make it possible to export the canvas's contents for use as a desktop background.  

To use this project, you can check it out with `git clone`, then run `npm install` to install dependencies, followed by `npm start` to launch it.  It's not available as a public package right now, while I clean up some of the code and flesh out some more functionality, but I do host it at [twoplustwoequalsfish.com](https://twoplustwoequalsfish.com/arting).
